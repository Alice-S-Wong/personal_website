                <h2>Why I Cosplay</h2>
                <p>As a child, I didn't get the chance to dress up much at Halloween and I was rather restricted in what I could wear when playing dress-up. Cosplay is in part my desire to be able to reclaim that part of my childhood, dreaming of dressing up as a princess or various other characters. Another big part of why I cosplay is because I'm rather fond of fashion from various periods, both current and historical. I also love the ability to become someone else for a day and to see what it's like to be a certain character for a time. Cosplay is a combination of the words costume and play and I wholeheartedly believe that play is important in the world of cosplay. At the end of the day, it's not about how many awards you've won or how many people complimented your costume. It's about whether you enjoy cosplaying the character and the process that went into making the outfit if you make your own cosplays.</p>
                <h2>How I Cosplay</h2>
                <p>I make the majority of my cosplays from scratch as I find that the cosplays I make myself are usually of better quality than mass-produced cosplays based on the same characters. Additionally, many of the characters I like to cosplay do not have mass-produced costumes, so making or commissioning a cosplay is the only option. I enjoy sewing, from conceptual sketches, to patterning, to cutting fabric, to sewing, and tailoring for that perfect fit. Making a cosplay from scratch often involves custom patterns, which in turn requires knowledge of how clothing fits the body, all things I had to pick up as part of being a cosplayer. Sometimes I will get lucky and find a pattern that is similar that I can modify to suit my needs. I've also learned a lot about fabric types and how they perform as part of a cosplay. The only things I generally don't make for cosplay are shoes and wigs, which I tend to purchase. I occasionally make my own props but I've been known to commission props as well.</p>
                <h2>Cosplays I've Done</h2>
                <p>Unfortunately I often forget to take photos of my cosplays, but I do have a few I'm particularly proud of.</p>
