                <h2>How I Write</h2>
                <p>While I have written short stories and poetry, most of work tends to be novel length works in the fantasy or science-fiction genres, or more likely than not, a mixture of both. My inspiration stems from a wide variety of sources, including Disney movies, RPG video games, Star Wars, Marvel Comics and many other things. I have always enjoyed telling stories, and I find myself more capable with written works than other media such as drawing, comics, or movie-making.</p>
                <p>There are a number of 'tropes' or 'motifs' that show up a lot in my stories. Here are a few of them.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A female protagonist: I take after Hayao Miyazaki in this regard, who also has almost exclusively female protagonists. I feel that there are not enough works with female protagonists and I find writing their stories to be more interesting. It's a welcome departure from the typical male journey/saga that is common in mainstream media. With these protagonists, they tend to have things in common. Some of these things include being small and look younger than they actually are, being roughly fourteen years old, and being naive but selfless. Of course not all of them follow this mold, but it's common.</li>
                  <li>Dragons: I love dragons. And other mythical creatures like phoenixes but dragons have been a favorite for years. I often find a way to incorporate them, even if just as a cameo or a one-off reference.</li>
                  <li>A fantasy world that hides science-fiction elements. Whether it's a secret organization in plain sight with futuristic magi-technology or a technologically-advanced empire surrounded by an unbreachable energy shield, I somehow find ways to insert science-fiction elements into my fantasy works.</li>
                  <li>Magi-technology/Magitek: This term refers to magic that has been studied and refined into a science and used to power technology. An example would be a gun that shoots fire magic instead of bullets. I am fond of the intersections between magic and technology and how they would mesh in a world where magic actually exists.</li>
                  <li>Airships: If there was something I liked as much a dragons, it's probably airships. Dirigibles, flying age-of-sail ships, wooden ships held aloft by balloons, futuristic airplane-like ships, I love them all. They have a habit of showing up in the strangest places.</li>
                </ul>
